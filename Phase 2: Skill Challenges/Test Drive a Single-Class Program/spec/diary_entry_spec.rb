# 1. Describe the Problem
# As a user
# So that I can track the books I'm reading
# I want to know what diaries I'm reading, how long they are
# and how long it would take me to read them
# 2. Design the Class Signature
# name of Class: DiaryEntry
# title method: returns title as string
# contents method: returns contents as string
# count_words method: returns word count as integer
#Â reading_time method: takes 'words per minute' as input and returns
# reading time as an integer
# reading_chunk: returns newest, unread 
# chunk of contents as a string 
# (length will depend on wpm and minutes available). If
# contents are fully read, restart from beginning of contents
