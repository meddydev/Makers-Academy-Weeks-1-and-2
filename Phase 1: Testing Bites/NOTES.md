Notes to self: 

- Make sure that when writing the string between 'it' and 'do' that it's readable by humans. For example, in the check_codeword exercise in 'Testing Methods With Equality', I put "returns 'Correct! Come in.' when passed 'horse' for my first test whereas a more readable message might be "returns a correct message if given the right codeword".

- When testing classes with equality, use class name rather than a string when describing what's being tested (between 'describe' and 'do')
